What are the most important parameters to get the simulation running. 
    Having the dict/json and loading it into the pipeling. (protein class) 
    use the simulation config as a base set of params. 
    Pass them into a json file and make sure they make sense. 
    Where are we loading this and how is it getting loaded into the protein class itself. 
    
    wherever the protein class is instantiated, 
    we want it be instantiated with all the parameters. 
    Then we need a funciton to save those params into a file.
